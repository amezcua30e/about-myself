# about-myself
My name is Erick Amezcua and I am 23 years old. I am currently doing an MA in Int'l Econ & Fin with a concentration in data analytics at Brandeis International Business School. I did my undergrad at Brandeis too where I did a BA in both economics and film studies. I have experience in media production, customer service, project management, and much more. Today, my goal is to break into the data analysis as I believe in data and I follow the data wherever it goes. I am currently focusing on building my data analytics portfolio to showcase my skills. This is my film/photography-related website:https://amezcua30e.wixsite.com/my-site

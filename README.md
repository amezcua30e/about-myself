# about-myself
My name is Erick Amezcua and I am 24 years old. I recently completed my MA in  Int'l Econ & Fin with a concentration in data analytics at Brandeis International Business School. I did my undergrad at Brandeis too where I did a BA in both economics and film studies. I have experience in media production, customer service, project management, data analysis and more. I am currently looking for full-time roles, preferably analytical ones. To see some of my creative work visit my Instagram page @photography30e
